# The Development of Dugtong Buhay Para kay Juan:  
A Basic Life Support Educational App for The University of Makati

In critical emergencies, the availability of immediate response and life-saving skills can mean the difference between survival and fatality. Despite the global and national recognition of Basic Life Support (BLS) and first aid as essential competencies, studies reveal a significant gap in public knowledge and preparedness, especially among students outside health-related fields.
